Nested Schema for vm_processor
Optional:

compatibility_for_migration_enabled (Boolean) Specifies whether the virtual processor's features are to be limited for compatibility when migrating the virtual machine to another host.
compatibility_for_older_operating_systems_enabled (Boolean) Specifies whether the virtual processor's features are to be limited for compatibility with older operating systems.
enable_host_resource_protection (Boolean) Specifies whether to enable host resource protection on the virtual machine. When enabled, the host will enforce limits on some aspects of the virtual machine's activity, preventing excessive consumption of host compute resources. VM activities controlled by this setting include the VMbus pipe messages associated with a subset of the VM's virtual devices, and intercepts generated by the VM. The virtual devices affected include the video, keyboard, mouse, and dynamic memory VDEVs.
expose_virtualization_extensions (Boolean) Specifies whether the hypervisor should expose the presence of virtualization extensions to the virtual machine, which enables support for nested virtualization.
hw_thread_count_per_core (Number) Specifies the number of virtual SMT threads exposed to the virtual machine. Setting this value to 0 indicates the virtual machine will inherit the host's number of threads per core. This setting may not exceed the host's number of threads per core. Note: Windows Server 2016 does not support setting HwThreadCountPerCore to 0. For more details, see Configuring VM SMT settings using PowerShell.
maximum (Number) Specifies the maximum percentage of resources available to the virtual machine processor to be configured. Allowed values range from 0 to 100.
maximum_count_per_numa_node (Number) Specifies the maximum number of processors per NUMA node to be configured for the virtual machine.
maximum_count_per_numa_socket (Number) Specifies the maximum number of sockets per NUMA node to be configured for the virtual machine.
relative_weight (Number) Specifies the priority for allocating the physical computer's processing power to this virtual machine relative to others. Allowed values range from 1 to 10000.
reserve (Number) Specifies the percentage of processor resources to be reserved for this virtual machine. Allowed values range from 0 to 100.
